## Introduction

Handwritten digit classification is a common task in computer vision that involves recognizing numeric digits (0-9) from images. This project demonstrates how to build a neural network using TensorFlow to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of 28x28 pixels, representing grayscale images of handwritten digits.

## Features

- **TensorFlow Implementation**: The project uses TensorFlow for building and training the neural network.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Preloaded dataset with labeled images for training and testing.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy and loss metrics for model performance evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to visualize training progress and results.
